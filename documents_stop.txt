really bad example in the description delete columns to make sorted we are given an array a of n lowercase letter strings  all of the same length  now  we may choose any set of deletion indices  and for each string  we delete all the characters in those indices  the remaining rows of strings form columns when read north to south  for easy greedy 
why this problem is medium? delete columns to make sorted we are given an array a of n lowercase letter strings  all of the same length  now  we may choose any set of deletion indices  and for each string  we delete all the characters in those indices  the remaining rows of strings form columns when read north to south  for easy greedy
